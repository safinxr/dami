                        Who decides what are the best anime series of 2021? Me? You? Or perhaps it’s a matter of personal taste. There’s so much to consider when putting together a list like this. Like, whether or not to place quality over fan favourites or if the most influential anime series deserves a special place at the top.Many movie and television projects of 2020 were pushed to 2021. Due to this, it clearly wasn't a typical year for the entertainment industry. The medium of anime, too, wasn't untouched by the swathe of delays, but despite the changes in the 2020 anime calendar, many long-awaited anime films still premiered throughout the year and graced the screens of viewers from all over the world.
